## Last Week's Accomplishments
Researched various ways to connect an Arduino to a WPA2 encoded network: Arduino is not configured to work on a WPA2 network, so I tried to find a library
that would serve a workaround. I didn't really find anything. I was able to connect to a hotspot on my phone and to an external router, so I know the only issue is the WPA2
## This Week's Plan
Switching gears: I'm going to get the mobile application's API hosted on a remote server, so we can actually run the app outside of local host. I have no idea how
to do this, so research and tutorials are in my future

## Anything Blocking?
Nope, just need to do research
