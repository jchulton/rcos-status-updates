## Last Week's Accomplishments

I did some work on the manual conversion from swift to kotlin code to get the android app working. Sicne the two langauges are very similar
mechanically, this is really just changing sythax and other minor differences. Unfortuantely, there is a LOT of files, so no end in sight ):
I also took some days off over Thanksgiving, plan to do more next week.
Also, the test of the app and circuit on the door at AMOS EATON was successful!!!! (: (:

## This Week's Plan

Continue work on the kotlin conversion. Going to help send the IOS app to the app store and help with the patenting of the circuitry. 
The group will discuss how to go forward.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
