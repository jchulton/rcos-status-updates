## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've gone through the steps to set up a virtual machine running mac-sierra 12. Unfortunately, without a valid activation code, I can't actually
install the software. So, I've started converted the Swift code to Kotlyn by hand (probably what I should have just done in the first place).
As I go, I learn more about kotlyn and android development

## This Week's Plan
Continue work on the kotlyn conversion. Help with the demo if needed (we've going to get together for a full test with Sunday)

## Anything Blocking?
No
