## Last Week's Accomplishments

The app is now executable from your phone via a Raspberry Pi using raspbery tunneling. The app is also now executable from your phone via an
Arduino using bluetooth. I've also found a swift to kotlin converter to help create the android version of the app, however it also works on a mac,
so I'm going to build a VM in a Mac envirnoment.

## This Week's Plan
Build the Mac VM and try out the swift-kotlin converter. Meet with everyone this Sunday to discuss our next steps

## Anything Blocking?
I need some files from a friend who owns a Mac to make the VM. I've asked and they should be coming soon
