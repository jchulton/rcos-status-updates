## Last Week's Accomplishments

Most of this week was spent experimenting with IP tunneling and researching various ways to build the android version of the app.
IP tunneling can now be used to connect with the raspbery pi to connect to tunnel access the application outside of localhost (finally). We've
decided to switch from a two different applications (one IOS and one Android version to one version written in React Native). We've also decided
to move away from IP tunneling, and wifi in general, and towards bluetooth, as it will allow us to keep cost down by using the Arduino instead
of Raspberry pi. Unfortunately, this means most of what I've done this week won't be in the final product, but I'll still document it, as it will work as a 
fallback plan if we can't get bluetooth working

## This Week's Plan
Research how to use React Native. Work with the rest of the team this Sunday to put together all of the pieces for a working prototype. Get bluetooth working

## Anything Blocking?
I just ordered the bluetooth module, so I have to wait for it to arrive.

## Notes 
Hopefully Native Modules will give me more oprotunities for repository commits. I'll also work on documenting what I've already done and committing it
