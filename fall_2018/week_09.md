## Last Week's Accomplishments

More work going from kotlin to swift. Sorry to sound like a broken record, but there are a lot of files that make up the original IOS app that needed changes. Unfortuantely, I'm not really learning much more at this point, it's really jsut doing the same thing a LOT of times.

## This Week's Plan

I had hoped to finish the conversion this semester, but looking at what I have left, that doesn't seem likely. I'm planning on doing a bit more, documenting what I did and how to convert from kotlin to swift so it can be picked up easily

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
