## Last Week's Accomplishments

Experimented with Microsoft Azure and the hosting of the website. The idea was to use Azure like a remote server to host the application. I was able to host a sample website. I then switched to IP tunneling, which links a local-hosted application to an IP address, allowing an outside user to connect to the app. I used this on my version of the app, which is unfortantely not working (but IP tunnelling seems to work).

## This Week's Plan
Connect with the rest of the team, apply IP tunneling to the working version of the IOS app (I can't because I don't have mac or android). Work on the android version of the app

## Anything Blocking?
Need to convene with team to galk about next move
