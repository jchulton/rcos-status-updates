## Last Week's Accomplishments

Experimented with Arduino, the mini-computer which will receieve a signal to open a door. Installed Arduino software and wrote basic programs, including a program which should allow the Arduino to connect to a router (didn't get to test it unfortunately, see blocking). Researched on how to connect to RPI Wifi with the Arduino.

## This Week's Plan
First, test the connection to a router, than figure out how to connect to RPI Wifi with the Arduino. If I complete these and have extra time, talk with Jing about having the app communicate with the Arduino via this connection.

## Anything Blocking?
Not anymore, however I was having trouble sending code to the Arduino. The Arduino couldn't connect to my computer, despite being physically plugged in. This happened seemingly randomly: I was able to send code, then just wasn't. I showed it to my team member Darius and he had similar problems, but was able to fix it at today's meeting. The connection between my computer is slow, even with a wired connection, but at least it works
